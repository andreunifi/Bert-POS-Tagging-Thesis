# POS Tagging with BERT Models

This repository contains code and resources for training BERT-based models on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging tasks. POS tagging is a fundamental step in natural language processing that involves assigning grammatical categories (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a sentence.

## Introduction

This repository explores the use of BERT-based models for POS tagging and aims to compare the performance of different transformer models and BERT tokenizers. The project leverages the powerful pre-training capabilities of BERT for fine-tuning on POS tagging datasets.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers library (Hugging Face)
- Other dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pos-tagging-bert.git
cd pos-tagging-bert
```

2. Download the pre-trained BERT models and tokenizer weights:

```bash
python download_weights.py
```

3. Follow the instructions in the [Training](#training) section to fine-tune the BERT models on your POS tagging dataset.

4. Evaluate the trained models using the guidelines in the [Evaluation](#evaluation) section.

## Training

To fine-tune the BERT models on your POS tagging dataset, run:

```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/pos_tagging_dataset --model_type bert-base-uncased --epochs 3 --batch_size 32
```

Adjust hyperparameters and paths as needed.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained models on a test set:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/trained_model --test_data /path/to/test_dataset
```
